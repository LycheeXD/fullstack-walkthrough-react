# Step 0 

We begin a new node project using `npm init`.

This creates a `package.json` file.

We run the following command to install the basic packages we need to get started:

`npm install --save express body-parser`

TIP: if you are installing multiple packages at once, you can list them one after the other in the when you run `npm install`

The above line is equivalent to:
`npm install --save express`
`npm install --save body-parser` 

with the added benefit of not having to wait until each package finishes installing to install the next one.
