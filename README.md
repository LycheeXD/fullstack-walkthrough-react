# Step 1

Now we begin to start adding our own files.

We begin first by creating a `server` folder. As the name suggest, we will use this folder to store all things server related, including models, routes, templating engines, and other middleware.

Within this `server` folder, we create a `server.js`. This will serve as the start point of our web app.

We will then include the bare minimum commands inside `server.js` to get a server up and running.
